# Snake Game
A simple javascript version of the classic game "snake."

This project was meant to teach myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was originally very messy and linear code, but I have cleaned it up a bit since then (it is still fairly linear and is definitely not object-based);

### How to use
You can use this in your own projects, just insert the code from this repo (fairly short). It does not have any dependencies and uses only default HTML, CSS, an JavaScript.

Adjust the constants at the top of snake.js to tweak the game to your liking (includes dimensions and colors).

### Live demo
This game is live on my site at egvincent.com/snake, have a look!
