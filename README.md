# Snake Game
A simple javascript version of the classic game "snake."

This project was meant to teach myself how to use the basics of html, css, and how to use 2D canvas elements in javascripts. This means the project's html, css and javascript are very sloppy, but as *it is an old project, I will not fix them*, but instead, work on new projects!

Initially a jsbin.com project -- check it out at www.jsbin.com/mizowezuyaxe
